This is the official repository for [_myMusicBender_](http://oa.upm.es/47446/).

Application that communicates with a Kinect for Xbox 360 and collects depth images to capture the user's movements and hand gestures, translating them in real-time into musical sounds. The sound signals are generated from scratch in an FPGA, applying music synthesis knowledge.
